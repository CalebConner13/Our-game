Story:
1. Fallout
2. Science fiction
	
Maybe our player could be a mercenary with the ultimate goal of rescuing his 
long lost puppy/girl/kid/cousin? I'm thinking he/she starts of waking up from
being kidnapped and has to escape so he can begin his search.

That works for me. We wouldn't /have/ to do FO themed, just thought the SPECIAL system would work well.
