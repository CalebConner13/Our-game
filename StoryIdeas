B : Maybe our player could be a mercenary with the ultimate goal of rescuing his 
	long lost puppy/girl/kid/cousin? I'm thinking he/she starts of waking up from
	being kidnapped and has to escape so he can begin his search.

C: That works for me. We wouldn't /have/ to do FO themed, just thought the SPECIAL system would work well.

B: Could always change the skill attributes if necessary, at least we have it working
